### Natours website

This website has been designed as part of a project.

# Key points of this project:

- We learned the clip-path usage: the hero section image has been cut, with the clip path
  CSS value. The image has been given as `background: url()` which has also a linear gradient with some
  opacity.
- Following, the 3 images have been `absolute` placed, plus on hover they have a scale property + `z-index:3;`

- This is the effect for a gradient writing:

```
background-image: linear-gradient(to right, $light-color, $dark-color);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
  display: inline-block;
```

- Next, the background has been "Skewed" and the content has been "skewed back"
